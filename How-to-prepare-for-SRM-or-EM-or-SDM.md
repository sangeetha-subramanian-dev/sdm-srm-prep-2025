# How-to-prepare-for-SRM-or-EM-or-SDM
This repository includes resources which I gathered in the process of my interview preparation for Engineering Manager/Software Development Manager/SRE Manager(SRM) with my background of having expertise in AWS Cloud, Terraform, SRE. For anyone who is specialised in Frontend/Java prep this might differ a bit but on a high level this would be the structure for the Interview preparation

Since we're targeting SDM (Software Development Manager) or EM (Engineering Manager) roles, the preparation needs to span multiple dimensions. I have tried a very practical prep guide. This will cover what most top companies (FAANG, startups, product companies, SaaS, fintech, etc.) evaluate for EM/SDM/SRM roles:

## Leadership & Behavioral Interviews (50-60%)**
This is often the make-or-break part.

### What to Prepare:
1. People management stories
     * Hiring, coaching, performance management, conflict resolution.
2. Delivery management
     * How you handled project delays, stakeholder management, estimation, tradeoffs.
3. Cross-functional collaboration
     * How you worked with PM, UX, business, infra teams.
4. Vision & strategy
     * How you drove tech vision, architecture roadmap, team scaling.
5. Difficult conversations
     * Firing, promotions, mental health, underperformance.

### Tools to Use:
1. STAR format â€” Situation, Task, Action, Result.
2. Create a story bank: ~20 stories covering: Leadership, Failure & Learnings, Ambiguity handling, Technical decision making, Conflict resolution

## System Design (25-30%)
Very important for EM/SDM roles since you're expected to guide teams.

### What to Prepare:
1. High-level architecture design.
2. Tradeoffs (consistency, availability, latency, cost, scaling).
3. Cloud design (AWS, GCP, Azure).
4. Real world systems:
    * API gateway
    * Event-driven systems
    * Microservices vs monolith
    * CI/CD pipelines
    * Distributed caching
    * Rate limiting
    * Message queues

### Resources:
1. Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA)
2. System Design Primer (GitHub)
3. Alex Xu's System Design Interview Vol 1 & 2

## Technical Depth (10-15%)
They check whether you're technical enough to lead.

### What to Prepare:
1. Cloud (AWS / GCP) â€” VPC, IAM, S3, Lambda, ECS/EKS.
2. DevOps â€” Terraform, CI/CD, monitoring, observability.
3. SRE basics â€” SLAs, SLOs, error budgets. (specifically if you are targetting for Site Reliability Manager)
4. Security fundamentals.
5. Coding: light coding may be asked â€” scripting, pseudocode, algorithmic thinking.

## Org/Team Building & Leadership (10%)
How you scale teams and build high performance.

### What to Prepare:
1. Hiring philosophy
2. Culture building
3. Performance management framework
4. Diversity & Inclusion
5. Leading during uncertainty
6. Mentoring & career growth

# Is this same across all companies?
If you ask if this interview structure same across all companies, well it might differ a bit. 
Short answer is,
âœ… 80% prep is common (system design + behavioral + leadership stories).
âœ… 20% needs to be tuned depending on where you're interviewing (based on tier, company, role level (SDM1 vs SDM2 vs EM Director, etc.)

Let me break it down for you across tiers 

| Tier                                                          | Companies                                                                    | What's Same                                                                                                                                      | What's Different                                                                                                                                               |
